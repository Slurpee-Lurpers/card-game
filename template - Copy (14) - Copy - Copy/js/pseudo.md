function(click){
    counter = 0

    cards go up(){
        when this is done counter += 1

    counter === 1?
    cards go together(){
        counter += 1000

}

make a list of the order of animations
the list will have all of the time it takes to complete each animation

initial :
deal the cards out : 3250
flip : 50

add eventlistener at 1050

gameFunction :
cards go up : 1000
cards flip : 600
cards come together : 500
cards go down : 500
deal the cards out: 



the zindex of the back of the cards needs to be higher than the card 'underneath' it
 
the zindex of the front of the cards needs to be lower than the card 'underneath' it


TO DO
consider tackling the DEAL problem (zindex) ((ew))


fix the box shadow on flip

add instructions on clicks
use the 'count' variable and some timeouts

styling:
front page (welcome screen) could use a LOT of work
background, maybe images, font, colors, position etc

maybe on click instead of toggle hidden make a nice transition?

choose a nice background

instead of using a css pseudo class for the hover effect
use JS mouseover or at least make it look nice
add transition 0.5sec

fix the alignment of the cards themselves ()
set card width to a percentage
set min width to px
set min height to px

the instruction height could be less
and game height could be more

consider changing the cards we are using

and find the picture to use for the extra card
